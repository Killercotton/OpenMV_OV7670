This is a list of all commits that relate to the ST Cube HAL, including
additions, modifications and deletions.  Any commit which touches the HAL
should be separate from any other changes and should be listed here, most
recent commit at the top of the list.  This makes it easier to upgrade to
a new HAL version.
