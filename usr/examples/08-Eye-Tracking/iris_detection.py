# Iris Detection Example
#
# This example shows how to find the eye gaze (pupil detection) after finding
# the eyes in an image. This script uses the find_eyes function which determines
# the center point of roi that should contain a pupil. It does this by basically
# finding the center of the darkest area in the eye roi which is the pupil center.

    for face in objects:
