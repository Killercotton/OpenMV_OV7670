# Basic Frame Differencing Example
#
# Note: You will need an SD card to run this example.
#
# This example demonstrates using frame differencing with your OpenMV Cam. It's
# called basic frame differencing because there's no background image update.
# So, as time passes the background image may change resulting in issues.

import sensor, image, pyb, os, time

sensor.reset() # Initialize the camera sensor.
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565) # or sensor.GRAYSCALE
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA) # or sensor.QQVGA (or others)
sensor.skip_frames(10) # Let new settings take affect.
sensor.set_whitebal(False) # Turn off white balance.
clock = time.clock() # Tracks FPS.

if not "temp" in os.listdir(): os.mkdir("temp") # Make a temp directory

print("About to save background image...")
sensor.skip_frames(60) # Give the user time to get ready.
sensor.snapshot().save("temp/bg.bmp")
print("Saved background image - Now frame differencing!")

while(True):
    clock.tick() # Track elapsed milliseconds between snapshots().
    img = sensor.snapshot() # Take a picture and return the image.

    # Replace the image with the "abs(NEW-OLD)" frame difference.
    img.difference("temp/bg.bmp")

    print(clock.fps()) # Note: Your OpenMV Cam runs about half as fast while
    # connected to your computer. The FPS should increase once disconnected.
